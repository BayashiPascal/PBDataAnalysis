if seed = random
  init the center of each cluster with a random value inside the bounds
  of the input data
else if seed = Forgy
  init the center of each cluster with one of the input data randomly
  choosen, one given input data can't be choosen twice
else if seed = pluspus
  choose one center uniformly at random from among the data points
  for each data point x, compute D(x), the distance between x and the
  nearest center that has already been chosen
  choose one new data point at random as a new center, using a weighted 
  probability distribution where a point x is chosen with probability 
  proportional to D(x)
  repeat the previous 2 steps until k centers have been chosen
loop until clusters' center have all converged
  init K empty sets S[]
  for each input data I
    ID = get the cluster containing I
    add I to S[ID]
  for each set S[I]
    AVG = calculate the average value of the input in S[I]
    if AVG is equal to the center of the I-th cluster
      the center of the I-th cluster has converged
    else
      set the center of the I-th cluster to AVG
