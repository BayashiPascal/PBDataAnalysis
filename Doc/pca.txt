Projection on the 'n' first principal components of the 'nbSample' 
samples (vectors of dimension 'dim') of the data set 'dataset'
A[i][j] <=> value of matrix A at the i-th column and j-th row

set := normalized and centered version of dataset
cov := covariance matrix of 'set' (matrix of dimensions 'dim' columns 
  and 'dim' rows)
components := eigenVector of 'cov' ('dim' vectors of dimension 'dim')
A := create a matrix of dimensions 'dim' columns and 'n' rows
for i := 0 to 'dim'
  for j := 0 to 'n'
    A[i][j] := (j-th components)[i]
B := create a matrix of dimensions 'nbSample' columns and 'dim' rows
for i := 0 to 'nbSample'
  for j := 0 to 'dim'
    B[i][j] := (i-th sample)[j]
C := A * B (matrix of dimensions 'nbSample' columns and 'n' rows)

The projection of the i-th sample is the i-th column of C (vector of 
dimension 'n')
